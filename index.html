            <button onclick="underline(this);" id="3-2"><sup><b>2</b></sup> For neither I, nor any other such one, can come up to the wisdom of the 
            blessed and glorified Paul. He, when among you, accurately and steadfastly 
            taught the word of truth in the presence of those who were then alive. And 
            when absent from you, he wrote you letters, which, if you carefully study, 
            you will find to be the means of building you up in that faith<br/></button><br/><br/>

            that “as we brought nothing into the world, so we can carry nothing out,” 
            let us arm ourselves with the armor of righteousness; and let us teach, first

            love and purity tenderly loving their own husbands in all truth, and loving 
            all [others] equally in all chastity; and to train up their children in the 
            knowledge and fear of God.<br/></button><br/><br/>
            <button onclick="underline(this);" id="4-3"> <sup><b>3</b></sup> ³Teach the widows to be discreet as respects the faith of the Lord, 
            praying continually for all, being far from all slandering, evil-speaking, 
            false-witnessing, love of money, and every kind of evil; knowing that they 
            are the altars of God, that He clearly perceives all things, and that nothing is 
            hidden from Him, neither reasonings, nor reflections, nor any one of the 
            secret things of the heart.<br/></button><br/><br/>

        <p>
            <button onclick="underline(this);" id="5-1"><sup><b>1</b></sup> Knowing, then, that “God is not mocked,” we ought to walk worthy of 
            His commandment and glory.<br/></button><br/><br/>
            <button onclick="underline(this);" id="5-2"><sup><b>2</b></sup> In like manner should the deacons be blameless before the face of His 
            righteousness, as being the servants of God and Christ, and not of men. 
            They must not be slanderers, two-faced, or lovers of money, but temperate 
            in all things, compassionate, industrious, walking according to the truth of 
            the Lord, who was the servant of all. If we please Him in this present world, 
            we shall receive also the future world, according as He has promised to us 
            that He will raise us again from the dead, and that if we live worthily of Him, 
            “we shall also reign together with Him,” provided only we believe.<br/></button><br/><br/>
            <button onclick="underline(this);" id="5-3"><sup><b>3</b></sup> In like manner, let the young men also be blameless in all things, being 
            especially careful to preserve purity, and keeping themselves in, as with a 
            bridle, from every kind of evil. For it is well that they should be cut off from 
            the lusts that are in the world, since “every lust warreth against the spirit; 
            “ and “neither fornicators, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with 
            mankind, shall inherit the kingdom of God,” nor those who do things 
            inconsistent and unbecoming. Wherefore, it is needful to abstain from all 
            these things, being subject to the presbyters and deacons, as unto God and 
            Christ. The virgins also must walk in a blameless and pure conscience.<br/></button><br/><br/>

        <p>
            <button onclick="underline(this);" id="6-1"><sup><b>1</b></sup> And let the presbyters be compassionate and merciful to all, bringing 
            back those that wander, visiting all the sick, and not neglecting the widow, 
            the orphan, or the poor, but always “providing for that which is becoming in 
            the sight of God and man; “abstaining from all wrath, respect of persons, 
            and unjust judgment; keeping far off from. all covetousness, not quickly 
            crediting [an evil report] against any one, not severe in judgment, as 
            knowing that we are all under a debt of sin.<br/></button><br/><br/>
            <button onclick="underline(this);" id="6-2"><sup><b>2</b></sup> If then we entreat the Lord to forgive us, we ought also ourselves to 
            forgive; for we are before the eyes of our Lord and God, and “we must all 
            appear at the judgment-seat of Christ, and everyone must give an account of 
            himself.”<br/></button><br/><br/>
            <button onclick="underline(this);" id="6-3"><sup><b>3</b></sup> Let us then serve Him in fear, and with all reverence, even as He 
            Himself has commanded us, and as the apostles who preached the Gospel 
            unto us, and the prophets who proclaimed beforehand the coming of the 
            Lord [have alike taught us]. Let us be zealous in the pursuit of that which is 
            good, keeping ourselves from causes of offence, from false brethren, and 
            from those who in hypocrisy bear the name of the Lord, and draw away vain 
            men into error.<br/></button><br/><br/>

            the devil; and whoever perverts the oracles of the Lord to his own lusts, and 
            says that there is neither a resurrection nor a judgment, he is the first-born of 
            Satan.<br/></button><br/><br/>
            <button onclick="underline(this);" id="7-2"><sup><b>2</b></sup> Wherefore, forsaking the vanity of many, and their false doctrines, let 
            us return to the word which has been handed down to us from the beginning; 
            “watching unto prayer,” and persevering in fasting; beseeching in our 
            supplications the all-seeing God to “not lead us into temptation.” As the 
            Lord has said: “The spirit truly is willing, but the flesh is weak.”<br/></button><br/><br/>

        <p>
            <button onclick="underline(this);" id="8-1"><sup><b>1</b></sup> Let us then continually persevere in our hope, and the earnest of our 
            righteousness, which is Jesus Christ, “who bore our sins in His own body on 
            the tree,” “who did no sin, neither was guile found in His mouth,” but 
            endured all things for us, that we might live in Him.<br/></button><br/><br/>

                he shall be defiled by idolatry, and shall be judged as one of the heathen. 
                But who of us are ignorant of the judgment of the Lord? “Do we not know 
                that the saints shall judge the world?” as Paul teaches.<br/></button><br/><br/>

                I have become acquainted with your name, much-beloved in God, which you have acquired by the habit of righteousness, according to the faith and love in Jesus Christ our Saviour. Being the followers of God, and stirring up yourselves by the blood of God, you have perfectly accomplished the work which was beseeming to you. For, on hearing that I came bound from Syria for the common name and hope, trusting through your prayers to be permitted to fight with beasts at Rome, that so by martyrdom I may indeed become the disciple of Him who gave Himself for us, an offering and sacrifice to God, Ephesians 5:2 [you hastened to see me ]. I received, therefore, your whole multitude in the name of God, through Onesimus, a man of inexpressible love, and your bishop in the flesh, whom I pray you by Jesus Christ to love, and that you would all seek to be like him. And blessed be He who has granted unto you, being worthy, to obtain such an excellent bishop.

And Crocus also, worthy both of God and you, whom I have received as the manifestation of your love, has in all things refreshed 1 Corinthians 16:18, etc. me, as the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ shall also refresh 1 Corinthians 16:18, etc. him; together with Onesimus, and Burrhus, and Euplus, and Fronto, by means of whom, I have, as to love, beheld all of you. May I always have joy of you, if indeed I be worthy of it. It is therefore befitting that you should in every way glorify Jesus Christ, who has glorified you, that by a unanimous obedience you may be perfectly joined together in the same mind, and in the same judgment, and may all speak the same thing concerning the same thing, 1 Corinthians 1:10 and that, being subject to the bishop and the presbytery, you may in all respects be sanctified.

                I do not issue orders to you, as if I were some great person. For though I am bound for the name [of Christ], I am not yet perfect in Jesus Christ. For now I begin to be a disciple, and I speak to you as fellow-disciples with me. For it was needful for me to have been stirred up by you in faith, exhortation, patience, and long-suffering. But inasmuch as love suffers me not to be silent in regard to you, I have therefore taken upon me first to exhort you that you would all run together in accordance with the will of God. For even Jesus Christ, our inseparable life, is the [manifested] will of the Father; as also bishops, settled everywhere to the utmost bounds [of the earth], are so by the will of Jesus Christ.

For your justly renowned presbytery, worthy of God, is fitted as exactly to the bishop as the strings are to the harp. Therefore in your concord and harmonious love, Jesus Christ is sung. And man by man, become a choir, that being harmonious in love, and taking up the song of God in unison, you may with one voice sing to the Father through Jesus Christ, so that He may both hear you, and perceive by your works that you are indeed the members of His Son. It is profitable, therefore, that you should live in an unblameable unity, that thus you may always enjoy communion with God.

Let no man deceive himself: if any one be not within the altar, he is deprived of the bread of God. For if the prayer of one or two possesses Matthew 18:19 such power, how much more that of the bishop and the whole Church! He, therefore, that does not assemble with the Church, has even by this manifested his pride, and condemned himself. For it is written, God resists the proud. Let us be careful, then, not to set ourselves in opposition to the bishop, in order that we may be subject to God.

It is manifest, therefore, that we should look upon the bishop even as we would upon the Lord Himself. And indeed Onesimus himself greatly commends your good order in God, that you all live according to the truth, and that no sect has any dwelling-place among you. Nor, indeed, do you hearken to any one rather than to Jesus Christ speaking in truth.

They that are carnal cannot do those things which are spiritual, nor they that are spiritual the things which are carnal; even as faith cannot do the works of unbelief, nor unbelief the works of faith.
